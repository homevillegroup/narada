## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Always change default admin credentials
   export ADMIN_USERNAME=your-secure-username
   export ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-secure-password
   ```

2. **Use Strong JWT Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Generate a strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
   export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   ```

3. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with SSL certificates
   - Never run NARADA directly exposed to the internet without HTTPS

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep NARADA updated to the latest version
   - Monitor security advisories

5. **Network Security**
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Consider VPN-only access for the management interface
   - Regularly audit access logs

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow principle of least privilege

3. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Implement proper logging (without sensitive data)

## üîç Security Features

NARADA includes several built-in security features:

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt for password storage
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks (planned)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of user actions
- **Key Masking**: Sensitive data masked in UI and logs

## üö´ Known Security Considerations

1. **File System Access**: NARADA requires read/write access to WireGuard configuration files
2. **Root Privileges**: May require elevated privileges for WireGuard operations
3. **Network Exposure**: Management interface should not be directly exposed to the internet
